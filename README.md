# Heat-Propagation-Simulator
Simulation of heat propagation as a function of time on two-dimensional surfaces of different materials and displaying it through a heat map, using Bilinear Interpolation to smooth the coloring at the boundary between points.

You will find the calculus in the **heatproject.ipynb** notebook and the results (heatmaps) in the **gifs** folder.
